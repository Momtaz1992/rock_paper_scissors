# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be played by two players,
either against each other or against the computer.

The game includes a user interface that allows players to choose their moves by clicking on buttons for rock, paper, or scissors. 
The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, which determines the winner of each round based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors.

The game also includes a score tracker that keeps track of the current score for each player, 
as well as a reset button that allows players to start a new game.

This project is a great exercise for learning JavaScript, 
as it requires implementing a simple game logic and manipulating the DOM to update the user interface.
It can also be expanded upon by adding additional features, such as a leaderboard or different game modes.

The code for this project is open-source and available on GitHub, making it easy to fork, modify, and contribute back to the project.
